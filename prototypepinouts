Pinouts for the habitpi prototype boards (keeping the shift register test at the same time)

SHIFT REGISTER TEST

GPIO23 = SHIFT REGISTER DATA
GPIO24 = SHIFT REGISTER CLOCK
GPIO25 = SHIFT REGISTER LATCH

EACH SHIFT REGISTER GOES TO AN LED

HABITPI SHIFT REGISTERS
2 SHIFT REGISTERS in series

GPIO 13 = REGISTER1 DATA
GPIO 19 = BOTH LATCH
GPIO 26 = BOTH CLOCK 

REGISTER1
Q0 = DISP DP
Q1 = DISP A
Q2 = DISP B
Q3 = DISP C
Q4 = DISP D
Q5 = DISP E
Q6 = DISP F
Q7 = DISP G
Q7'= REGISTER2 DATA


REGISTER2
Q0 = TRANSISTOR FOR DISP L4
Q1 = TRANSISTOR FOR DISP L3
Q2 = TRANSISTOR FOR DISP L2
Q3 = TRANSISTOR FOR DISP L1
Q4 = LED
Q5 = LED
Q6 = LED
Q7 = LED
Q7'= NONE
