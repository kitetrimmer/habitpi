# HabitPi

This is a  project that I am starting to track habits using a Raspberry Pi.  

I am still in the beginning phases of the project, so there won't be much here for a while.  The vision is to have a Raspberry Pi with a keypad and a multi-segment display.  When you touch a button, it will increment the number of days that you have completed the task (sort of like you have gone X days without missing one.  Right now, I'm thinking of having 4 registers - this seems like a good number of things to track, and it lines up with some of the input devices I am seeing.

This is an interesting project to me, because I am learning so much.  So far I've learned:
- How to connect a breadboard to the GPIO on a raspberry pi
- How to drive a 7-segment display
- Basics of Vim
- Basics of Python
- Some Sqlite - including date stuff, which seems very complicated to me, but I think I've almost got it.
- ssh configuration
- scp
- basic linux CLI commands
